# era-splitting-notebook-examples

Example Notebooks to Replicate Experiments from Era Splitting Paper. All notebooks should run top to bottom. The Shifted Sine Wave and Synthetic Memorization Data Set examples have some visuals there, the Numerai example notebook is more of a guide, since these experiments can take a long time to run depending on model parameters.

# Prerequisite
To get the Era Splitting models to run, you first need to install the Era Splitting fork of Scikit-Learn. Code and instructions are available here:
